        <p>
            hi, I'm Pieter a software developer, <br />
            I enjoy making clean and easy to use user experiences, <br />
            my passion is to personalize everything I use. <br /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            I started coding 5 years ago, <br />
            since then, <br />
            I've worked on projects ranging from websites to educative applications, <br />
            also I love to create fun engaging games in my free time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            from C# to No-code platforms, <br />
            I'm always open to learn new things.
        </p>
